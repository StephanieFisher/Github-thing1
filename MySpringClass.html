        <h2>Intro to Creative Writing</h2>
        <p>I only took one class last spring. In this class, we wrote creatively. We did a lot of workshops and critiqued each other's works. I had a lot of fun with this class because, for the most part, the teacher just told us to write. He occasionally gave prompts, but he never really checked our work on them, so we could write whatever we wanted. I'm not good at summaries, so I'll post an excerpt of some of my work.</p>
        <h3>Excerpt of "Master of Darkness"</h3>
        <p>Luke awoke in an unfamiliar place with a splitting headache. Never a good combination. Rubbing his eyes, the young college student let out a groan as he sat up and looked around. Then blinked in confusion. For Luke was sitting on a cheap medical cot in the most bizarre room he'd ever been in.</p>
        <p>He was surrounded by black. Plain black walls enclosed a perfectly square space that Luke estimated to be around twenty feet per side, while large, smooth, black bricks made up the floor. The ceiling was black, too, and blended into the top of the walls so well that it almost looked as if there was no ceiling at all, and the walls stretched on forever.</p>
        <p>But that wasn't the most interesting thing about the room. </p>
        <p>No, what had snared Luke's attention like a tar pit was the only visible way in or out of the room. On the opposite wall to where the student sat, lay a wrought iron gate. Luke could see cars rushing past on a city street beyond the black bars, and it appeared that the gate itself lay at the end of an alleywayâ€”there were narrow brick walls on either side, blocking off most of the view of the street.</p>
